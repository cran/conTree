Title: Contrast Trees and Boosting
Description: Contrast trees represent a new approach for assessing the
    accuracy of many types of machine learning estimates that are not
    amenable to standard (cross) validation methods; see "Contrast
    trees and distribution boosting", Jerome H. Friedman (2020)
    <doi:10.1073/pnas.1921562117>. In situations where inaccuracies
    are detected, boosted contrast trees can often improve
    performance. Functions are provided to to build such trees in
    addition to a special case, distribution boosting, an assumption
    free method for estimating the full probability distribution of an
    outcome variable given any set of joint input predictor variable
    values.
